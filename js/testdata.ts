export const example_text = `ðŸ§µOn Feminism's futile use of critical structuralism to differentiate itself from Queer Theory.

It's been difficult to write about this subject, because there are too many angles from which to approach it, and it bleeds into every facet of human experience.

I don't see the conflict of Feminism and Patriarch as being fundamentally different from any other systems of structural critique that we're observing today. I believe they're ultimately the engaging of the same conflict in human mind at different levels of analysis, different temporal frames, through different abstractions, and so on

It comes down to one simple thing: people can claim that they agree that biology is real or that there is objective truth or that there's a shared reality and that we can use critical thinking/logic and reason/enlightenment rationalism to do sensemaking at an agreeable and compatible standard for overcoming the predispositions of the embodied experience as a human being.

I don't think it's possible if we're also starting from a position which assumes that the terms being used in those evaluations are defined, chosen and dictated by those with structural power, and especially not if the source of the power is an abstraction which overrides the minds of those participating within the system.

While there is a kernel truth (we see evidence of this clearly in the form of ridiculous re-definitions for familiar terms which now add an ambiguous interface through which to be invoked), it's not the case that we're able take that kernel and expand it to a mechanism (beyond liberalism) such as to hold individuals or "groups" responsible, as that mechanism would satisfy anyone's argument for tyrannical restructuring of society based on their chosen theory of power structures as a means of pursuing their concept of liberation.

In fact, I am biased to make the opposite case, given my own experiences, but I know that such a pursuit is untenable. The moment we allege that a collective represents the Good vs another which represents that which is Other to it. The only rectification is either war or enslavement (or transition to mimic uniformity).

it's not going to be remarkably different, insofar as logical structure and operational mechanics, to argue the same thing in any subtype of social justice, be it vulgar Marxism, CRT, Queer Theory, and so on:

There is an abstracted entity for our system of evaluation with eternal status of sinner and oppressor. Those influenced by it have, at the very best, false consciousness (and thus no agency).

That entity, and its subordinates, can only prove to overcome presumed malice or false consciousness by continuously expressing perfect uniformity to an otherwise conflicting interlocutor.

There is no liberalism possible in such a process, and the consequence is:
1. Inability to defend any concept on the basis of logic and reason. If you do, it's only because it hasn't yet been brought into criticism
2. Anyone who continues defending that concept, or its anteceding definition (which will continously be sublated, supplanted and inverted) will be the far right.

It's not a matter of human opinion or politics - but simply the logical mechanism of no longer being able to conserve a concept. The very proposition of conserving a concept vs resynthesizing it is, logically, a left-right relationship dialectic.

This is why any argument from feminism against trans and queer is a conservative position, and why efforts become convoluted in the noise of contending over who is progressive.

Progress can no longer be measured in terms of logically analyzed conditions humans but as progress of history against an endpoint which, once based on supposing that perspectives are from a group, requires a collectivist representation and, as such, only ends when all that exists is an indistinct expression of that collective.

The alternative is the "double negation", where we enforce something that we claim to not want to keep forever, which comes from mystical thinking, and which is something that humans are extremely prone to implying in their behaviour (e.g. I'll stop before it's too late).

// `ðŸ§µOn specializing drag queens for children

// Who are these men? Do they portray themselves as modest females, in order to simply be convincing that they are they opposite sex? No. Not at all.
// .../`,

// `They are to be extravagant in their expression of the female form. A female that cannot be resisted. A female that won't be ignored. A female that attracts and tantalizes. A female that causes your blood flow to be diverted and your breath to be taken away.
// .../`,

// `This is accomplished through attire, which is generally made to be risque, to the makeup, which exaggerates the piercingly feminine and alluring eyes, the flushed and aroused cheeks and the big, smoochy lipstick-laden lips that are waiting to be tasted and kissed.
// .../`,

// `It is in the sway of hips and the swinging of bottoms that a spanking is hinted because they've been so so naughty. The twerking of the hips demand attention and yearn for the rich pleasures of the senses, which is something the transvestite queen insists is to be celebrated.
// ../`,

// `You might state that your particular drag queen was toned down, but toned down from what?

// Why must your favourite ritualistic ambassador through which to teach children of the new world be of a type which need be toned down?
// .../`,

// `Do you believe all Drag Queen Story Hours will have drag queens that are equally toned down and in the same ways?
// .../`,

// `It's quite curious, indeed, that the educators specifically designated or the enlightenment of children are to be ones with a particularly sexual dimension of expression that is, by default, reasonably expected in all other performative scenarios
// .../`,

// `(remember, Drag Queens existed before they became storybook companions for kids), save this one. Can we say with certainty that such is the design? Or is this simply an unexpected factor to be mitigated?
// .../`,

// `If such a dimension of expression were suppressed, would that not be considered contrary to the purpose of exposing children to an environment of performers who demonstrate the absence of limits and constraints?
// .../`,

// `Or, if this is a reasonable detail to attenuate, should it not be expected that such attenuation would take place to varying degrees (a *spectrum*, in fact!)?

// What is the preference of the DQSH advocate?

// .../`,

// `What accountability do they recommend for circumstances where appropriate attenuation is not achieved?
// (Oopsies, now your child is even wiser than you are).
// .../`,

// `Because it would be possible to choose any other form of performer or exemplar of a vocation, such as a handicapped athletic champion, daredevil or astronaut.
// .../`,

// `But they simply won't do, thus we need to understand why someone would insist upon this particular specialization, and it is simple: these performers, whether or not it is being presented purposefully and explicitly, hold continuous reference to sexual expression
// .../`,

// `(no, I don't mean the fact that they are human beings and humans are a sexually reproducing species with biological and social expression of sexuality, I mean that these performers specialize in expressing sexuality through their craft).
// .../`,

// `Not only is this known by all adults with any awareness of Drag Queen performance, but these same adults are aware of the ever-present potential for expressions to take place along the sexual dimension before these children.
// .../`,

// `It is not the stories being read, nor self-esteem, nor the presentation of identity categories in order to ensure the child will not fear or hate such identities. How do we know?
// .../`,

// `Drag isn't to present homosexuality (regardless of whether it may be present in the performance). You don't identify homosexuals by their being in drag. In fact, drag performers have often been heterosexuals who simply developed this particular talent and skillset.
// .../`,

// `The drag performer harbours potential for over-the-top sexual expression.

// .../`,

// `And with that fertile capacity for sexual expression situated right beneath the surface (and sometimes bursting out for all to see)..
// .../`,

// `The DQSH advocates can wink and giggle to one another (or to naive parents) about the thin layer of repressed sexual expression which erupt for the children at any moment.
// .../`,

// `Enjoy the contradiction of both wanting a performer who demonstrates "no limits or constraints" to the benefit of children, while also asserting that this performer will limit and constrain their sexual expression.
